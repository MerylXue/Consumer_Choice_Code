This code was tested on:

- Ubuntu Linux v18.04, v20.04 operating systems.
- Python v2.7, v3.6

It is designed with focus on its reusability and maintainability, taking advantage of several object oriented programming (OOP) features of Python. 
The implementation of the different algorithms is intended to be self-explanatory in terms of the names of the objects and functions used along the way.

The dependencies found in the file **requirements.txt** are necessary in order to successfully execute the code. They can be installed by running:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For more instructions just run:

```
$ python estimate.py
```

More examples on how to use the code also can be found on the **examples** folder.
