This code was tested on:

- Mac OSX 14.5
- Python v3.7, v3.8



This project is designed based on the code from "*A Comparative Empirical Study of Discrete Choice Models in Retail Operations"* by Gerardo Berbeglia, AgustiÂ­n Garassino, Gustavo Vulcano, [GitHub - ajgara/choice-models: Python package to work with Discrete Choice Models. ](https://github.com/ajgara/choice-models)The "README.md"is the documentation for  their code.
